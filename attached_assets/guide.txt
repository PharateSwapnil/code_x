3. Requirements.txt Necessity
Yes, a requirements.txt file is recommended for easier setup, even though you're using pyproject.toml. Benefits include:

It's the standard format that most Python developers understand
It works with pip install -r requirements.txt command directly
It's compatible with more platforms and deployment services
I've created a comprehensive requirements.txt file above.

4. Unwanted Files for Local Running
Files you don't need to run locally:

deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b-specdec (appears to be an model data directory)
.replit and .streamlit configuration files
generated-icon.png (just an icon for Replit)
uv.lock (dependency lock file for Replit)
5. Parallel Processing Implementation
I've implemented parallel processing in several ways:

Added a ParallelProcessor utility class
Updated RepositoryHandler to support parallel file operations
Modified app.py to process files in parallel with progress indicators
Added concurrent file embedding generation
6. Support for Additional LLM Providers
I've added comprehensive support for:

Groq (already supported)
OpenAI
Anthropic/Claude
Google AI (Gemini)
Ollama (for local model usage)
